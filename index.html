                    In 26 of January 2026, had added some games: 

                    <!--
                        /games/bacts-sim
                        /games/vszombie
                    -->

                     and
                    <a url="https://googawooga.work.gd/games/bacts-sim/" target="_blank">VSZombie</a>.

                <li>
                    In 27 of January 2026, had deleted access for the games
                    (but the files of games is still contain on the repo)
                    cause of author can't to make fast game's files uploading to the user browser
                    (by easier language can't to make faster loading of a game).
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 7 of February 2026, had returned access to the games, but it's redirected to the

                    because of author can't to make faster loading of a game on PythonAnyWhere.
